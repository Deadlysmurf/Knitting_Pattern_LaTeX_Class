# Knitting Pattern LaTeX Class
A LaTeX class for formatting knitting patterns. I created it for personal use, and decided I should share it with more eyes - either for their use or reviews and suggestions.

Note: If you use the clean function, you will have to update the list of file types cleaned due to the use of glossaries.
